              As part of our submission for the IA Skills and Katalis
              initiative, we&apos;ve curated examples that reflect our ability
              to support government-backed platforms through digital campaigns,
              PR strategies, stakeholder alignment, and culturally relevant
              storytelling.

              These projects show how we translate complex objectives—like
              workforce readiness and economic cooperation—into measurable
              outcomes. Each link below offers deeper insight into the
              methodologies and impact behind our work.
